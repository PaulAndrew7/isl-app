00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,310
Hi, I’m Olivier.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,700
Welcome to Oxford Online English!

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,500
In this lesson, you can learn about
sentence structure in English.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,359
You’ll learn how to construct all kinds
of sentences in English, from the
simplest.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:23,019
Possible sentences, to long, complex
sentences which contain many different
ideas.

6
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,800
To begin, a question:.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,350
What is the simplest sentence you can
make in English?

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,920
What does every sentence in English need?

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,560
Every sentence needs a verb.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,370
The simplest sentence is an imperative,
which means when you tell someone to do
something.

11
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,079
For example:.

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,320
Run!

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,740
Leave!

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,000
Work!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,840
These are the simplest complete sentences
you can make in English; they are just
one.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,260
Word long!

17
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:05,179
Of course, most sentences are longer than
this.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,890
Most sentences that are longer than one
word also need a noun before the verb.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,879
This noun is the subject.

20
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,569
With a subject plus a verb, you can make
simple sentences :.

21
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,599
He runs.

22
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,019
She left.

23
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:26,609
They are working.

24
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:34,060
You can see that the verb can be in
different forms: past or present, simple
or continuous.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,490
The verb form doesn’t change the
structure of the sentence.

26
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:41,280
These are all the same: subject plus verb.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,710
Of course, these sentences aren’t very
interesting.

28
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,368
You can’t say much with short sentences
these.

29
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:50,430
Let is add a little more information.

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,500
Take the sentence he runs.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,769
What could you add after runs to make it
longer?

32
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,780
You could add an adverb of place:.

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,320
He runs around the park.

34
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,669
You could add an adverb of time:.

35
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,169
He runs every morning.

36
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,339
You could add both:.

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,420
He runs around the park every morning.

38
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,579
You could add an adverb of manner:.

39
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,540
He runs slowly.

40
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:33,620
You can see that you have many choices,
but your choices are also limited.

41
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,730
In this case, you can use different kinds
of adverbs, but there are also things you.

42
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,649
Can’t use.

43
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,200
For example, you can’t use another verb
after run, you can’t use an adjective,
and.

44
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,879
You can’t use a noun, or at least you
can’t use a noun with this meaning of run.

45
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,620
This is an important point, let is look
at it in more detail.

46
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:08,299
To build grammatically complete sentences
in English, there is one important
question:.

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,150
What needs to come next?

48
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,020
For example, you saw the sentence he runs.

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,200
That is a complete sentence.

50
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,920
You can put a full stop after runs, and
it is correct.

51
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,259
It is very basic, but it is correct.

52
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:28,750
What about these:.

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,680
She likes He wants.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,540
We go.

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,930
These aren’t complete sentences.

56
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,439
Can you explain why not?

57
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,979
They aren’t complete, very simply,
because they aren’t finished.

58
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,469
Look at the first sentence: She likes.

59
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:49,469
She likes…what?

60
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,289
She has to something.

61
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:53,568
He wants….

62
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,259
What does he want?

63
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,500
You can’t just ‘want’, you have to want
something.

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,039
We go….

65
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,840
Where?

66
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:06,519
At this point, we want to teach you a
word: complement.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,370
The complement is the thing you add after
a verb to make a sentence complete.

68
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,798
A complement can have many different
forms.

69
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,409
It can be a noun, a verb, an adjective or
an adverb.

70
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,639
These things can be single words or
phrases.

71
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,180
For example, when we say ‘noun’, we also
mean noun phrases.

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:45,579
, table is a noun, and the wooden table
which my grandmother gave me is also a
noun.

73
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:50,709
Both nouns refer to one object—one table.

74
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:56,039
For this lesson, a noun can be one word,
or a phrase.

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,770
, let is practice.

76
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,240
Look at the first sentence: she likes.

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,500
How could you finish this?

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,870
What are the possible complements?

79
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,899
Pause the video and write down three
endings for your sentence.

80
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,228
Try to use different ideas and structures.

81
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,379
Ready?

82
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,920
Let is look at some possible answers.

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,560
These are just our suggestions; of course
there are many possibilities!

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,410
She likes strawberries.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,240
She likes swimming.

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,629
She likes getting up before the sun rises.

87
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:38,310
She likes to listen to music while she
works.

88
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:46,000
You can see that there is more than one
possible complement: you can use a noun,
a gerund (a.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,279
Verb with -ing which acts a noun), a
gerund phrase, or an infinitive verb with.

90
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,959
‘to’.

91
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,888
, you have many choices!

92
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,240
However, before, your choices are also
limited.

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,949
Only certain structures are possible.

94
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:08,129
The idea of complements isn’t just for
the first verb in the sentence.

95
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,589
Many words need a complement.

96
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,538
For example, look at one of the sentences
you just saw:.

97
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:19,639
She likes getting up before the sun rises.

98
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,170
Technically, you can say She likes
getting up.

99
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:30,960
It is a grammatically complete sentence,
but you’d never say it.

100
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,638
Why not?

101
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,379
Because it doesn’t make any sense.

102
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,918
You need more information.

103
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,990
She likes getting up… when?

104
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,620
Why?

105
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,250
How?

106
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,180
You need a complement after getting up to
complete the idea.

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,000
She likes getting up before….

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,829
Before also needs a complement.

109
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,680
You can’t stop there.

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,990
Before what?

111
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,269
She likes getting up before the sun….

112
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,318
This also doesn’t work, because it
doesn’t make sense.

113
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,169
It doesn’t make sense because the sun
needs a complement.

114
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,068
Before the sun does what?

115
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,319
She likes getting up before the sun rises.

116
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,779
, finally we have a sentence which is
both grammatically complete and which
communicates.

117
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,359
Meaning.

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,080
What should you remember from this?

119
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:39,068
Remember that when you use a particular
word, you have limited choices in what
word.

120
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,960
You use next.

121
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:49,659
To speak or write in clear, correct
English, you don’t just need to know
English words.

122
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,800
You need to know what can come next.

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,500
For example, with a verb or want, it is
not enough to know the verb.

124
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,490
You also need to know whether the verb
needs a complement, and what complements
are—or?

125
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,160
Aren’t—possible.

126
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,430
This is why it is good to learn
vocabulary in full phrases and sentences.

127
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,348
That way, you’ll know how to use the
words you learn to make sentences you can
use in?

128
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:28,219
Your spoken or written English.

129
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,750
Using what you’ve seen up to now, you can
build many simple English sentences.

130
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:44,179
Let is see how you can add more
information and more detail to these
simple sentences.

131
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:52,419
You can add information to a simple
sentence in two ways: you can add
adjectives or adverbs.

132
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:58,579
Let is look at an example, using a
sentence we started before, but we didn’t
finish:.

133
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,940
He wants….

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,959
, you should do some work!

135
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,409
Pause the video, and finish this sentence
in three different ways.

136
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:12,319
Start again when you have your answers.

137
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,820
Ready?

138
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,480
Here is our suggestion:.

139
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,329
He wants to buy a car.

140
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:24,578
Now, let is add some description using
adjectives and adverbs.

141
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:29,969
Can how you could add adjectives to this
sentence?

142
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,360
You could add adjectives before the word
car, this:.

143
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,100
He wants to buy a new car.

144
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,310
He wants to buy a second-hand car.

145
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:48,969
He wants to buy a bright red car.

146
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,009
What about adverbs?

147
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:55,690
Could you add adverbs to these sentences
to add some details?

148
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,829
There are many possibilities; for
example:.

149
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:03,508
Apparently, he wants to buy a new car.

150
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,528
He wants to buy a second-hand car next
month.

151
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:12,198
He wants to buy a bright red car for his
new girlfriend.

152
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:17,578
You can see that adverbs can be single
words or phrases.

153
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:22,849
Adjectives can go before the noun they
describe, or after some verbs.

154
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,579
Adverbs are more complicated, and can go
in many different positions.

155
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:34,568
However, this is the important point:
using adjectives and adverbs this doesn’t.

156
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:38,958
Change whether a sentence is complete or
not.

157
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,248
If you say:.

158
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,860
He wants to buy a car.

159
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,808
That is a complete sentence.

160
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:50,110
You can add adjectives and adverbs to it
to make it more detailed:.

161
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,980
Apparently, he wants to buy a second-hand
car for his new girlfriend.

162
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:03,379
However, if a sentence is incomplete,
then you can’t make it complete by adding
adjectives.

163
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,499
Or adverbs:.

164
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:07,939
He wants to buy….

165
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:10,558
This sentence is incomplete.

166
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:14,058
Adding adjectives and adverbs won’t make
it complete.

167
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:19,610
, at this point, you can build a simple
sentence.

168
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,720
You also hopefully understand something
about complements and why they are
important for?

169
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,980
Making complete sentences, and now you
can also add description to a complete
sentence.

170
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,320
Using adjectives and adverbs.

171
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,280
Let is see how you can combine these
simple sentences into complex ones.

172
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,039
First, let is define some words.

173
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:56,139
A conjunction is something which joins
two sentences or two parts of a sentence
together.

174
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:06,009
Words and, but, if, although, because or
which are conjunctions.

175
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:12,688
A complex sentence contains two or more
parts joined with a conjunction.

176
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:16,118
These parts are called clauses.

177
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:24,350
An independent clause expresses a
complete idea, and could stand by itself.

178
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,869
A dependent clause would not make sense
if it were by itself.

179
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:38,259
A dependent clause depends on an
independent clause in the same sentence
in order to have.

180
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,259
Meaning.

181
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:44,938
Don’t worry if this is new—you don’t need
to remember everything now.

182
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:52,490
You’ll see lots of examples of these
ideas in this section and the next
section, too.

183
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,700
In this section, you are going to learn
about complex sentences with two
independent clauses.

184
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,140
, enough abstract talk!

185
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,000
Let is see some examples:.

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,519
He runs around the park every morning, he
is in pretty good shape.

187
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:14,078
She likes strawberries, but she hardly
ever eats them.

188
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,620
You should write to her and thank her for
the present.

189
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,470
These are simple examples of complex
sentences.

190
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:32,509
Here is your recipe: independent clause +
conjunction + independent clause.

191
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:38,460
You generally need a comma at the end of
the first clause, before the conjunction,
but.

192
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:46,189
Comma rules are quite flexible in
English, you won’t always need a comma.

193
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:48,738
Look at the first example:.

194
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:55,929
He runs around the park every morning, he
is in pretty good shape.

195
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:59,819
Which word is the conjunction?

196
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,879
The conjunction is .

197
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:08,340
You can split this sentence into two
full, meaningful sentences:.

198
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,939
Let is look at one more:.

199
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:17,509
She likes strawberries, but she hardly
ever eats them.

200
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:24,159
Again, you can split this into two full
sentences.

201
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,459
You might think that the second sentence.

202
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,079
Here isn’t complete or doesn’t make sense
by itself.

203
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,660
As it is, you’d be .

204
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:40,629
However, you can change them to
strawberries, and then it is a complete,
meaningful sentence:.

205
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:45,199
But, she hardly ever eats strawberries.

206
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:51,149
You can keep adding conjunctions and
clauses for as long as you want:.

207
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:57,668
She likes strawberries, but she hardly
ever eats them, and she doesn’t earn much
money,.

208
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:04,009
She has to be careful how much she spends
on groceries, and fresh food is generally?

209
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:10,879
More expensive than canned or frozen
produce, ….

210
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,249
Of course, just because you can, it
doesn’t mean it is a good idea.

211
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:21,519
Sentences with too many clauses are
difficult to follow, it is generally
better to limit.

212
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,448
Your complex sentences to two or,
maximum, three clauses.

213
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:33,208
Now, how to build complex sentences using
independent clauses.

214
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:38,758
What about dependent clauses?

215
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,279
Do you remember the definition of a
dependent clause?

216
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,860
A dependent clause is a part of a
sentence which would not make sense by
itself.

217
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,729
Let is see an example:.

218
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:56,559
She is taller than I am.

219
00:15:56,558 --> 00:16:00,259
This short sentence has two clauses.

220
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:06,350
Can where the two clauses start and end,
and which one is dependent?

221
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,899
The two clauses are:.

222
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,458
She is taller.

223
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,578
And: Than I am.

224
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:16,169
They are linked with the conjunction than.

225
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:21,558
The second clause, than I am, is
dependent.

226
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,919
It doesn’t make sense by itself.

227
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:30,519
Let is see some other ways to build
complex sentences with dependent clauses.

228
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:42,239
You can add a dependent clause with
conjunctions if, because, although,
unless, or wherever.

229
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,759
For example:.

230
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,769
If you are late, I’ll leave without you.

231
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:53,230
He is broke because he spent all his
money on beer.

232
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:59,399
Although she spends a lot of time at
work, she doesn’t get much done.

233
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,480
I won’t do it unless you come with me.

234
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,640
We can meet wherever you want.

235
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,400
Often, you can change the order of the
two clauses if you want, you can say:.

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,269
If you are late, I’ll leave without you.

237
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:22,009
Or: I’ll leave without you if you are
late.

238
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:26,860
Notice that there is a comma between the
two clauses if the dependent clause is
first,.

239
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,258
But not if the independent clause is
first.

240
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:37,349
What is the difference between these
complex sentences and the ones you saw in
part four?

241
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,819
Here, you can’t split the sentence in two.

242
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:47,189
, you can, but one of the two parts won’t
make sense:.

243
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,679
If you are late.

244
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,278
I’ll leave without you.

245
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:59,329
I’ll leave without you is an independent
clause, it makes sense by itself.

246
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:06,480
But the other clause—if you are late—is
dependent, and it doesn’t make sense by.

247
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,940
Itself.

248
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,308
It needs something more to make it
complete.

249
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:21,119
What other common ways are there to build
complex sentences with dependent clauses?

250
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:27,129
Another common structure is relative
clauses, using relative pronouns who,
which or.

251
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,419
What to link two clauses.

252
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,419
For example:.

253
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,230
That is the guy who shouted at me.

254
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,670
I have no idea what is going on.

255
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,019
They gave us a cake which was made from
dried beetroot.

256
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:46,299
In these cases, the dependent clause goes
after the independent clause.

257
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:50,319
Let is review what you’ve learned in this
lesson.

258
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,500
You can build a very simple sentence,
with just a verb:.

259
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:56,960
Work!

260
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,940
You can add a subject and complement to
make a simple sentence:.

261
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,350
She works in a zoo.

262
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:09,109
You can use adjectives and adverbs to add
description.

263
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:13,808
Apparently, she works in a private zoo.

264
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:20,000
You can make a complex sentence by adding
a second independent clause, with a
conjunction.

265
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,690
Apparently, she works in a private zoo,
she must know a lot about animals.

266
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,929
You can also make a complex sentence by
adding a dependent clause, or even
several dependent.

267
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:40,780
Clauses, again using conjunctions to
connect them.

268
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:48,648
Apparently, she works in a private zoo,
she must know a lot about animals, which
surprises.

269
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:57,148
Me because as far as I know she studied
economics at university, although I guess
I could be.

270
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:00,558
Wrong.

271
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:07,019
This is a big topic, and it will take you
time to learn everything about these
points.

272
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:12,849
Studying conjunctions and how they work
can help you to build complex sentences
which?

273
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:15,788
Are clear and correct.

274
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:22,180
Relative clauses are another useful topic
if you want to improve your sentence
grammar.

275
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:28,509
Learning about relative clauses can help
you to connect your ideas in complex
sentences.

276
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:35,849
It is also a good idea to study verb
complements and learn what structures you
can or can’t?

277
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:39,480
Use after a verb.

278
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,079
Remember that a lot of sentence structure
is being able to answer the question:
“What.

279
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,480
Needs to come next?”.

280
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,339

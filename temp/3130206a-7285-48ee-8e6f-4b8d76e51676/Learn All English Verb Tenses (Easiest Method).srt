00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
hi I'm Brian wilds and in this video I'm

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,559
going to explain how to use all 12

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,120
tenses in English let's get started as

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,199
you might be aware English has four

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,199
present tenses and you're probably

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,640
familiar with the present simple as in I

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,759
study we use this tense when talking

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:27,039
about facts habits and schedules that is

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:31,519
my phone fact he studies every day habit

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,079
on weekends we play soccer schedule the

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,039
present simple is by far the most common

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,679
verb tense in English so you'll get

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,799
plenty of practice with this over time

14
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:45,039
the present continuous I am studying we

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,599
use the present continuous to describe

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,079
actions that are happening right now as

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:57,000
in you are watching this video right now

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:00,198
I am speaking on camera an airplane is

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,920
flying through the sky with this tense

20
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:07,759
the action is happening as we speak the

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,960
present perfect I have studied we use

22
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,840
the present perfect when talking about

23
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:17,438
how an action from the past describes

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,000
the subject now as in I have studied

25
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:24,199
English for 3 years in this sentence

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,879
have studied English is a past action

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,400
but we're using it to describe who I am

28
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,158
now it's my experience and we often use

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,478
the present perfect to talk about

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,640
someone's experience or lack of

31
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:42,118
experience she has eaten breakfast

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,759
already he has lived there all his life

33
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:48,239
they have never been to Mexico we're

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,000
using past experience to describe who

35
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,919
the subject is now and that's why this

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,640
is a present tense and finally the

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,039
present perfect continuous I have been

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,118
studying we use the present perfect

39
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,799
continuous to talk about an action that

40
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:08,598
started in the past and continues

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,599
nonstop into the present I have been

42
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:14,919
studying Spanish for8 years in other

43
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:18,119
words I started studying 8 years ago I

44
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:21,598
never stopped and I'm still learning now

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,280
I have been studying we often use this

46
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,280
tense to emphasize when an ongoing

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,120
action first started he has been

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,159
sleeping for 12 hours she has been

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,719
working two jobs since February they

50
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:41,840
have been traveling for 5

51
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,598
weeks okay ready to talk about the past

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,120
let's do it and again we have four

53
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,238
tenses first up is the past simple I

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,879
studied this tense is very

55
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,878
straightforward and very common we use

56
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,479
it when talking about an action that

57
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:59,959
started in the past and finished in the

58
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,598
past for example she worked last night

59
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,519
night in other words she started work

60
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:09,318
last night and she finished work last

61
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,000
night he ate eggs for breakfast he ate

62
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:16,238
eggs then he's not eating them now I

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,878
lived in Chicago when I was a child I

64
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,200
liveed there then and I don't live there

65
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:25,518
now why because an action in the past

66
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,598
simple is always finished in the past

67
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,799
great now we have the past continuous I

68
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,238
was studying we use the past continuous

69
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,760
to describe an action that continued

70
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,759
over a period of time in the past I was

71
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,759
studying but more specifically we almost

72
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:47,318
always use this tense to give context or

73
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,719
background for another action I was

74
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:54,639
studying when the phone rang we were

75
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:58,400
living in Canada when we got engaged he

76
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:02,518
was running when he caught the ball the

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,400
past perfect I had studied this tense is

78
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,438
also used to provide context for another

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,120
action in the past but the past perfect

80
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:15,598
always comes beforehand Sarah had

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,639
already left by the time he got home in

82
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,959
other words Sarah left before he got

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,759
home it could have been a minute before

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,399
an hour before or a year before all we

85
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,319
know is she had already left let's look

86
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:33,120
at two more examples I had already

87
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,000
booked the tickets when the concert sold

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,478
out in other words I booked the tickets

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,519
before the concert sold out we had eaten

90
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,478
a big lunch so we weren't hungry when we

91
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:48,839
got to the hotel in other words we ate a

92
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:52,599
big lunch before we got to the hotel so

93
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:56,638
we weren't hungry and finally the past

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,919
perfect continuous I had been studying

95
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,879
and again we almost always use this

96
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,639
tense to give context but the past

97
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,839
perfect continuous describes an action

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,000
that continued over time and then

99
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:13,239
stopped at the moment of another action

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,759
I had been watching TV when the power

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,319
went out I was watching I was watching I

102
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,800
was watching power went out no more

103
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,639
watching he had been eating pizza every

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,840
day when he started the diet eating

105
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,000
pizza eating pizza eating pizza started

106
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:32,799
the diet we had been talking about about

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,839
going to France for years and finally

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,759
decided to go talking about going

109
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,799
talking about going talking about going

110
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,280
decided to go congratulations we've now

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,240
covered all the past tenses of English

112
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,839
excellent work we're on to the final

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,439
stretch the future and again we've got

114
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,799
four tenses let's begin with the future

115
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,759
simple I will study we use the future

116
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,240
simple to talk about actions that we

117
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:01,400
believe will happen in the future I will

118
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,918
call you tomorrow we'll bring cupcakes

119
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,879
to the party he'll be there by 6:00 p.m.

120
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,680
and yes most of the time English

121
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:15,000
speakers shorten the word will to as in

122
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,240
I'll study you'll study he'll study etc

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,199
etc and there's another form of the

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,319
future simple that you might already be

125
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,199
familiar with going to or gonna as in

126
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:29,039
I'm going to call you tomorrow we're

127
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,478
going to bring cupcakes to the park he's

128
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,478
going to be there by 6:00 p.m. the will

129
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:39,120
and going to forms have the same meaning

130
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:43,120
but going to or GNA is more casual the

131
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,240
future continuous I will be studying we

132
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,439
use the future continuous to talk about

133
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,439
an action that we believe will continue

134
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,598
over a period of time in the future for

135
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:56,560
example we will be eating dinner from

136
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,839
6:00 to 7:00 p.m. I'll be running

137
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,079
errands all afternoon and again we can

138
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,478
also use going to instead of will

139
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:09,680
they're going to be traveling all summer

140
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:13,519
the babies going to be sleeping when you

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,038
arrive the future perfect I will have

142
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,359
studied we use the future perfect to

143
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:20,598
talk about actions that will be finished

144
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,280
by a certain time in the future for

145
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:26,120
example she will have moved to a new

146
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,359
apartment before the end of the year in

147
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,478
other words here's the end of the year

148
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,680
and she'll move to a new apartment

149
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,120
sometime before that could be a day

150
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,280
before a week before a month before

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,519
anytime let's look at two more examples

152
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,439
he will have finished his homework by

153
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,198
the time dinner is ready so dinner is

154
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,680
ready and he finished his homework some

155
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,879
time before that they will have come

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,120
home by the spring so spring comes and

157
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,919
they came home sometime before that the

158
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,879
action will be finished before a given

159
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:07,639
time in the future and finally the

160
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,560
future perfect continuous I will have

161
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,800
been studying so this time we're talking

162
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,959
about a continuous action that will be

163
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,000
completed at a given time in the future

164
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:22,439
he will have been driving for 6 hours

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,879
straight when he arrives now honestly

166
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,360
English speakers rarely use this tense

167
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,840
but when we do it's to emphasize the

168
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,240
duration of an action how long long it

169
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,718
will take we will have been living in

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,278
Los Angeles for a decade this December

171
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,120
she will have been working at the

172
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:45,080
company for 40 years when she retires

173
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,720
and that's it we've covered all 12

174
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,278
tenses of English congratulations if you

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,360

00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,200
let me know and as always thanks for
